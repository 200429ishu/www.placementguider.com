Q1)What is C++? <br><br>

Answer : <br><br>

C++ is an object-oriented programming language that was introduced to overcome the<br> 
jurisdictions where C was lacking. By object-oriented we mean that it works with the concept <br>
of polymorphism, inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, object, and class. <br><br>

Q2) what are the advantages of c++ programming language?  <br><br> 

Answer : <br><br>

Advantages of C++: <br><br>

C++ is an OOPs language that means the data is considered as objects.<br> 
C++ is a multi-paradigm language; In simple terms, it means that we can program<br>  
the logic, structure, and procedure of the program.<br> 
Memory management is a key feature in C++ as it enables dynamic memory allocation<br> 
It is a Mid-Level programming language which means it can develop games, <br> 
desktop applications, drivers, and kernels. <br><br>

Q3) Define token in C++? <br><br>

Answer : <br><br>

A token is the smallest individual element of a program that is understood <br> 
by a compiler. A token comprises the following:  <br><br>

<ul><li>

Keywords – That contain a special meaning to the compiler</li><br> 
<li>Identifiers – That hold a unique value/identity</li> <br> 
<li>Constants – That never change their value throughout the program</li> <br> 
<li>Strings – That contains the homogenous sequence of data</li> <br> 
<li>Special Symbols – They have some special meaning and cannot <br> 
be used for another purpose; eg: [] () {}, ; * = # </li>
 </ul><br><br>

Q4)  What are classes and objects in C++? <br><br>

Answer : <br><br>

A class is a user-defined data type where all the member functions and data members 
are tailor-made according to demands and requirements in addition to which these all can be accessed 
with the help of an object. To declare a user-defined data type we use a keyword class. <br><br>

An object is an instance of a class and an entity with value and state; In simple terms, 
it is used as a catalyst or to represent a class member. It may contain different parameters or none. <br><br>

  <br><br> <br><br>

Q5) What are the various OOPs concepts in C++? <br><br>

Answer :<br><br>


Classes: It is a user-defined datatype
Objects: It is an instance of a class
Abstraction: It is a technique of showing only necessary details
Encapsulation: Wrapping of data in a single unit
Inheritance: The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class
Polymorphism: Polymorphism is known as many forms of the same thing.<br><br>

Q6)What is polymorphism in C++? <br><br>


Answer :  <br><br>

Polymorphism is known as many forms of the same thing. In simple terms, we can say 
that Polymorphism is the ability to display a member function in multiple forms depending 
on the type of object that calls them.  <br><br>

In other words, we can also say that a man can be an employee to someone, a son of someone, 
a father of someone, and a husband of someone; this is how polymorphism can be projected in real life. <br><br>

There is 2 type of polymorphism: <br><br>

<ul>
<li>Compile Time Polymorphism</li>
<li>Function Overloading</li>
<li>Operator Overloading</li>
<li>Run Time Polymorphism</li>
<li>Function Overriding</li>
<li>Virtual Function</li></ul> <br><br>

Q7) What is a Constructor in C++?  <br><br>

Answer : <br><br>

A Constructor is a special member function of a class and shares the same name as of class, 
which means the constructor and class have the same name. Constructor is called by the 
compiler whenever the object of the class is created, it allocates the memory to the object 
and initializes class data members by default values or values passed by the user while creating an object. 
Constructors don’t have any return type because their work is to just create and initialize an object. <br><br>

Syntax of Constructor: <br><br>
class scaler<br>
 {<br>
  public:<br>
    // Constructor<br>
    scaler()<br> { <br>
   // Constructor body.<br>
    }<br>
};
 <br><br>
Types of Constructors in C++: <br><br>

There are four types of constructors in C++  <br><br>

1)Default Constructors<br>
2)Parameterized Constructors<br>
3)Copy Constructors<br>
4)Dynamic Constructors<br><br>

Q8) What is a Destructor in C++?<br><br>

Answer :<br><br>

A Destructor is a member function that is instantaneously called whenever an object is destroyed. 
The destructor is called automatically by the compiler when the object goes out of scope, i.e., 
when a function ends, the local objects created within it are also destroyed. 
The destructor has the same name as the class name, but the name is preceded by a tilde(~). 
A destructor has no return type and receives no parameters. <br><br>

Syntax of Destructor:<br><br>
class scaler<br>
 {<br>
  public:<br>
   //constructor<br>
    scaler();<br>
   //destructor<br>
    ~scaler(); <br>
};
<br><br>

Q9) What is namespace in C++?<br><br>

Answer :<br><br>

If there are two or more functions with the same name defined in different libraries 
then how will the compiler know which one to refer to? Thus namespace came to the picture. 
A namespace defines the scope and differentiates functions, classes, variables etc. 
with the same name available in different libraries. The namespace starts with the keyword “namespace”. <br><br>
The syntax for the same is as follows:<br><br>

Syntax :<br><br>

namespace namespace_name <br>
{<br>
 
   // code declarations<br>
 
} <br><br>

Q10) What is operator overloading in C++?<br><br>

Answer :<br><br>

Operator overloading in C++ is an overloaded declaration is declaration in the same 
scope of function or operator declared with the same name more than once.<br><br>
