Q1: What is C programming?<br><br>

Answer:<br><br>

C is a structured, high-level, and general-purpose programming language, developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. 
C language is considered as the mother language of all modern programming languages, 
widely used for developing system software, embedded software, and application software.<br><br>

Example  :  <br><br>

#include <stdio.h> <br>
int main()<br> {<br>
  printf(“Hello, World!\n”);<br>
  return 0;<br>
}
<br><br>

Q2:Why is C called a mid-level programming language?<br><br>

Answer:<br><br>

Due to its ability to support both low-level and high-level features, C is considered a middle-level language. 
It is both an assembly-level language, i.e. a low-level language, and a higher-level language. 
Programs that are written in C are converted into assembly code, and they support pointer arithmetic (low-level) 
while being machine-independent (high-level). Therefore, C is often referred to as a middle-level language. 
C can be used to write operating systems and menu-driven consumer billing systems.<br><br>

Q4: What are tokens in C?<br><br>

Answer :<br><br>

Tokens are identifiers or the smallest single unit in a program that is meaningful to the compiler.<br><br>

Q5:  What are basic data types supported in the C Programming Language?<br><br>

Answer:<br><br>

Each variable in C has an associated data type. Each data type requires different amounts of memory and 
has some specific operations which can be performed over it. It specifies the type of data that the variable can store 
like integer, character, floating, double, etc. In C data types are broadly classified into 4 categories:<br><br>

Primitive data types:<br><br>

Primitive data types can be further classified into integer, and floating data types.<br><br>

Void Types: <br><br>

Void data types come under primitive data types. Void data types provide no result to
their caller and have no value associated with them.<br><br>

User Defined data types: <br><br>

These data types are defined by the user to make the program more readable.<br><br>

Derived data types: <br><br>

Data types that are derived from primitive or built-in data types.<br><br>

Q6: What is the use of printf() and scanf() functions? Also explain format specifiers?<br><br>

Answer:<br><br>

printf() is used to print the output on the display.
scanf() is used to read formatted data from the keyboard. <br><br>

Some datatype format specifiers for both printing and scanning purposes are as follows:<br><br>

%d: It's a datatype format specifier for printing and scanning an integer value. 
%s: It's a datatype format specifier for printing and scanning a string. 
%c: It's a datatype format specifier for displaying and scanning a character value.
%f: The datatype format specifier %f is used to display and scan a float value.<br><br>

Q7: What are static variables and functions?<br><br>

Answer:<br><br>

The variables and functions that are declared using the keyword Static are considered as Static Variable
and Static Functions. The variables declared using Static keyword will have their scope restricted to the 
function in which they are declared.<br><br>

Q8:What is the use of the function in C?<br><br>

Answer :<br><br>

Uses of C function are:<br><br>

C functions are used to avoid the rewriting the same code again and again in our program.
C functions can be called any number of times from any place of our program.
When a program is divided into functions, then any part of our program can easily be tracked.
C functions provide the reusability concept, i.e., it breaks the big task into smaller tasks so that it makes 
the C program more understandable.<br><br><br><br>


Q9: what is call by value in c?<br><br>

Answer :  <br><br>

When a copy of the value is passed to the function, then the original value is not modified.  
Actual arguments and formal arguments are created in separate memory locations. 
In this case, actual arguments remain safe as they cannot be modified.  
The copies of the actual arguments are passed to the formal arguments.<br><br>

Example for call by value:<br><br>

#include <stdio.h>  <br>
void change(int,int);  <br>
int main()<br>  
{  <br>
    int a=10,b=20;  <br>
    change(a,b); //calling a function by passing the values of variables.  <br>
    printf("Value of a is: %d",a);  <br>
    printf("\n");  <br>
    printf("Value of b is: %d",b);<br>  
    return 0;  <br>
}  <br>
void change(int x,int y)<br>  
{<br>
x=13; <br> 
    y=17;  <br>
}  
<br><br>


Output:<br><br>

Value of a is: 10<br>
Value of b is: 2  

<br><br><br><br>

Q10)what is call by reference in c ? 
<br><br>
Answer: <br><br>

When a copy of the value is passed to the function, then the original value is modified.  
Actual arguments and formal arguments are created in the same memory location.  
In this case, actual arguments are not reliable, as they are modified.  
The addresses of actual arguments are passed to their respective formal arguments.<br><br>

Example for call by reference:<br><br>

#include <stdio.h> <br> 
void change(int*,int*);  <br>
int main()  <br>
{  <br>
    int a=10,b=20;  <br>
    change(&a,&b); // calling a function by passing references of variables.  <br>
    printf("Value of a is: %d",a);  <br>
    printf("\n");  <br>
    printf("Value of b is: %d",b);  <br>
    return 0;  <br>
}  <br>
void change(int *x,int *y)  <br>
{  <br>
    *x=13;  <br>
    *y=17;  <br>
}  
<br><br>

Output:<br><br>

Value of a is: 13<br>
Value of b is: 17
<br><br>
