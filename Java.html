Q2)What is Java programming language used for?<br><br>

Answer :<br><br>
 
Because Java is a free-to-use and a versatile language, it builds localized 
and distributed software. Some common uses of Java include:<br><br>

1.     Game Development<br><br>
Many popular mobile, computer, and video games are built in Java. 
Even modern games that integrate advanced technology like machine learning 
or virtual reality are built with Java technology.<br><br>

2.     Cloud computing<br><br>
Java is often referred to as WORA – Write Once and Run Anywhere, making it 
perfect for decentralized cloud-based applications. Cloud providers choose 
Java language to run programs on a wide range of underlying platforms.<br><br>

3.     Big Data<br><br>
Java is used for data processing engines that can work with complex data 
sets and massive amounts of real-time data.<br><br>

4.     Artificial Intelligence<br><br>
Java is a powerhouse of machine learning libraries. Its stability and speed make it 
perfect for artificial intelligence application development like natural language 
processing and deep learning.<br><br>

5.     Internet of Things<br><br>
Java has been used to program sensors and hardware in edge devices 
that can connect independently to the internet.<br><br><br><br>

Q3) How is Java different from C++?<br><br>

Answer :<br><br>

C++ is only a  compiled language, whereas Java is compiled as well as an interpreted language.
Java programs are machine-independent whereas a c++ program can run only in the machine in which it is compiled. 
C++ allows users to use pointers in the program. Whereas java doesn’t allow it. Java internally uses pointers. 
C++ supports the concept of Multiple inheritances whereas Java doesn't support this. 
And it is due to avoiding the complexity of name ambiguity that causes the diamond problem.<br><br>

Q4) Explain public static void main(String args[]) in Java?<br><br>

Answer :<br><br>

main() in Java is the entry point for any Java program. 
It is always written as public static void main(String[] args).<br><br>

public:<br><br>Public is an access modifier, which is used to specify who can access this method. 
Public means that this Method will be accessible by any Class.<br><br>

static:<br><br> It is a keyword in java which identifies it is class-based. main() is made static in Java 
so that it can be accessed without creating the instance of a Class. In case, main is not made 
static then the compiler will throw an error as main() is called by the JVM before any objects are 
made and only static methods can be directly invoked via the class<br><br>.
 
void:<br><br> It is the return type of the method. Void defines the method which will not return any value.
main: It is the name of the method which is searched by JVM as a starting point for an application 
with a particular signature only. It is the method where the main execution occurs.<br><br>

String args[]: <br><br>It is the parameter passed to the main method<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

Q5)  Why Java is platform independent?<br><br>

Answer :<br><br>

Java is called platform independent because of its byte codes which can run 
on any system irrespective of its underlying operating system.<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

Q6) What are constructors in Java?<br><br>

Answer :<br><br>

In Java, constructor refers to a block of code which is used to initialize an object. 
It must have the same name as that of the class. Also, it has no return type and 
it is automatically called when an object is created.<br><br>

There are two types of constructors:<br><br>

Default Constructor:<br><br> In Java, a default constructor is the one which does not take any inputs. 
In other words, default constructors are the no argument constructors which will be created 
by default in case you no other constructor is defined by the user. Its main purpose is to initialize 
the instance variables with the default values. Also, it is majorly used for object creation. <br><br>

Parameterized Constructor:<br><br>The parameterized constructor in Java, is the constructor which is 
capable of initializing the instance variables with the provided values. In other words, 
the constructors which take the arguments are called parameterized constructors.<br><br>

Q7) What are the features of JAVA?<br><br>

Answer: <br><br>

Features of Java are as follows:<br><br>

1)OOP concepts<br>
2)Object-oriented<br>
3)Inheritance<br>
4)Encapsulation<br>
5)Polymorphism<br>
6)Abstraction<br><br>

Platform independent: A single program works on different platforms without any modification.<br><br>

High Performance:<br><br> JIT (Just In Time compiler) enables high performance in Java. 
JIT converts the bytecode into machine language and then JVM starts the execution.<br><br>

Multi-threaded: <br><br>A flow of execution is known as a Thread. JVM creates a thread 
which is called the main thread. The user can create multiple threads by extending 
the thread class or by implementing the Runnable interface.<br><br>

 <br><br><br><br>

Q8) Why is Java not purely Object-oriented? <br><br>

Answer :<br><br>

Java is not considered pure Object-oriented because it supports primitive 
data types such as boolean, byte, char, int, float, double, long, and short.<br><br>

Q9)Explain about local variables in Java?<br><br> 

Answer :<br><br>

Local Variables: A variable defined within a block or method or constructor is called a local variable. 
These variables are created when the block is entered or the function is called and destroyed after 
exiting from the block or when the call returns from the function. The scope of these variables 
exists only within the block in which the variable is declared. i.e. we can access these 
variables only within that block.
<br><br>
Example program:  <br><br>

// Java program to demonstrate local variables<br>
public class LocalVariable<br>
{<br>
    public void getLocalVarValue() <br>
    {   <br>
        // local variable age<br>
        int localVar = 0;<br>
        localVar = localVar + 11;<br>
        System.out.println("value of local variable" + 
                                 " is: " + localVar);<br>
    }<br>
    public static void main(String args[])<br>
    {<br>
        LocalVariable obj = new LocalVariable();<br>
        obj.getLocalVarValue();<br>
    }<br>
}<br><br>

Output:  <br><br>

value of local variable is: 11<br><br>

In the above program, the variable localVar is the local variable to the function getLocalVarValue(). 
If we use the variable localVar outside getLocalVarValue() function, the compiler 
will produce an error as “Cannot find the symbol localVar”. <br><br><br><br>

Q10)Explain about Instance variables in Java?<br><br>

Answer :<br><br>

Instance Variables: Instance variables are non-static variables and are declared in a 
class outside any method, constructor, or block. As instance variables are declared in a class, 
these variables are created when an object of the class is created and destroyed when the 
object is destroyed. Unlike local variables, we may use access specifiers for instance variables. 
If we do not specify any access specifier then the default access specifier will be used. <br><br>

Example program :<br><br>

// Java program to demonstrate instance variables<br>
public class InstanceVariable<br> {<br>
    int instanceVarId;<br>
    String instanceVarName;<br>
    public static void main(String args[])<br>
    {<br>
        InstanceVariable obj = new InstanceVariable();<br>
        obj.instanceVarId = 0001;<br>
        obj.instanceVarName = "InstanceVariable1";<br>
        System.out.println("Displaying first Object:");<br>
        System.out.println("instanceVarId==" + obj.instanceVarId);<br>
        System.out.println("instanceVarName==" + obj.instanceVarName);<br><br>
  
        InstanceVariable obj1 = new InstanceVariable();<br>
        obj1.instanceVarId = 0002;<br>
        obj1.instanceVarName = "InstanceVariable2";<br>
        System.out.println("Displaying Second Object:");<br>
        System.out.println("instanceVarId==" + obj1.instanceVarId);<br>
        System.out.println("instanceVarName==" + obj1.instanceVarName);<br>
    }<br>
}<br><br>

Output:<br><br>
 
Displaying first Object:<br>
instanceVarId==1<br>
instanceVarName==InstanceVariable1<br>
Displaying Second Object:<br>
instanceVarId==2<br>
instanceVarName==InstanceVariable2<br><br>
 

In the above program the variables i.e. instanceVarId, instanceVarName are instance variables. 
In case we have multiple objects as in the above program, each object will have its own copies of 
instance variables. It is clear from the above output that each object will have 
its own copy of the instance variable. <br><br><br><br>

Q11) Explain about static variables in Java?<br><br>

Answer :<br><br>

static variable: Static variables are also known as Class variables. <br><br>

These variables are declared similarly to instance variables, the difference is that static 
variables are declared using the static keyword within a class outside any method constructor or block.
Unlike instance variables, we can only have one copy of a static variable per 
class irrespective of how many objects we create.
Static variables are created at the start of program execution and destroyed automatically when execution ends.<br><br>
To access static variables, we need not create an object of that class, we can simply access the variable as:<br><br>

Example program :<br><br>

// Java program to demonstrate static variables<br><br>

public class StaticVar <br>{<br>
    private static int count = 0<br>;
    private int nonStaticCount = 0;<br>
  
    public void incrementCounter()<br>
    {<br>
        count++;<br>
        nonStaticCount++;<br>
    }<br>
    public static int getStaticCount()<br>
    {<br>
        return count;<br>
    }<br>
    public int getNonStaticCount()<br>
    {<br>
        return nonStaticCount;<br>
    }<br>
    public static void main(String args[])<br>
    {<br>
        StaticVar stVarObj1 = new StaticVar();<br>
        StaticVar stVarObj2 = new StaticVar();<br>
        stVarObj1.incrementCounter();<br>
        stVarObj2.incrementCounter();<br>
        System.out.println("Static count for stVarObj1: " + 
                               stVarObj1.getStaticCount());<br>
        System.out.println("NonStatic count for stVarObj1: " + 
                                 stVarObj1.getNonStaticCount());<br>
        System.out.println("Static count for stVarObj2: " + 
                                 stVarObj2.getStaticCount());<br>
        System.out.println("NonStatic count for stVarObj2: " + 
                                 stVarObj2.getNonStaticCount());<br>
    }<br>
}<br>

Output: <br><br>

Static count for stVarObj1: 2<br>
NonStatic count for stVarObj1: 1<br>
Static count for stVarObj2: 2<br>
NonStatic count for stVarObj2: 1<br><br>
