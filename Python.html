Q1) What is Python? <br><br>

Answer: <br><br>

Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. 
Being a general-purpose language, it can be used to build almost any type of 
application with the right tools/libraries. Additionally, python supports objects, 
modules, threads, exception-handling, and automatic memory management which 
help in modelling real-world problems and building applications to solve these problems.<br><br>

Q2) What are the benefits of using Python?  <br><br>

Answer:<br><br>

Benefits of using Python:<br><br>

Python is a general-purpose programming language that has a simple, easy-to-learn 
syntax that emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. 
Moreover, the language is capable of scripting, is completely open-source, and supports third-party 
packages encouraging modularity and code reuse.
Its high-level data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, 
attract a huge community of developers for Rapid Application Development and deployment.<br><br>

Q3) What is pass in Python?<br><br>

Answer :<br><br>

The pass keyword represents a null operation in Python. It is generally used for the purpose of filling up 
empty blocks of code which may execute during runtime but has yet to be written. Without the pass 
statement in the following code, we may run into some errors during code execution.<br><br>

Q4) Is Python a compiled language or an interpreted language?<br><br>

Answer :<br><br>

Actually, Python is a partially compiled language and partially interpreted language. 
The compilation part is done first when we execute our code and this will generate byte code 
internally this byte code gets converted by the Python virtual machine(p.v.m) according to 
the underlying platform(machine+operating system).<br><br>

Q5) How are arguments passed by value or by reference in Python?<br><br>

Answer :<br><br>

Everything in Python is an object and all variables hold references to the objects. 
The reference values are according to the functions; as a result, you cannot change the 
value of the references. However, you can change the objects if it is mutable.<br><br>

Q6) Difference between for loop and while loop in Python.<br><br>

Answer :<br><br>

The “for” Loop is generally used to iterate through the elements of various collection 
types such as List, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary. Developers use a “for” loop where they 
have both the conditions start and the end. <br><br>Whereas, the “while” loop is the actual looping 
feature that is used in any other programming language. Programmers use a Python while 
loop where they just have the end conditions.<br><br>

Q7)What are Built-in data types in Python?<br><br>

Answer :<br><br>

The following are the standard or built-in data types in Python:

Numeric: The numeric data type in Python represents the data that has a numeric value. 
A numeric value can be an integer, a floating number, a Boolean, or even a complex number.
Sequence Type: The sequence Data Type in Python is the ordered collection of similar or 
different data types. There are several sequence types in Python:<br><br>

1)Python String<br>
2)Python List<br>
3)Python Tuple<br>
4)Python range<br><br>

Mapping Types:<br><br> In Python, hashable data can be mapped to random objects using a mapping object. 
There is currently only one common mapping type, the dictionary, and mapping objects are mutable.<br><br>

Set Types: <br><br>In Python, a Set is an unordered collection of data types that is iterable, mutable, and 
has no duplicate elements. The order of elements in a set is undefined though it may consist of various elements.<br><br>

Q8)What is pep 8?<br><br>

Answer :<br><br>

PEP in Python stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. It comprises a collection of 
guidelines that outline the optimal approach for crafting and structuring Python code to 
ensure the utmost clarity and legibility<br><br><br><br>

Q9) what are advantages and disadvantages of python programming language?  <br><br>

Answer :<br><br>

Advantages: <br><br>

1)Presence of third-party modules <br><br>

2)Extensive support libraries(NumPy for numerical calculations, 
Pandas for data analytics, etc.)<br><br> 

3)Open source and large active community base 
Versatile, Easy to read, learn and write<br><br>

4)User-friendly data structures <br><br>

5)High-level language <br><br>

6)Dynamically typed language(No need to mention data type based on the 
value assigned, it takes data type)<br><br>
 
7)Object-Oriented and Procedural  Programming language
Portable and Interactive<br><br>

8)Ideal for prototypes – provide more functionality with less coding<br><br>

9)Highly Efficient(Python’s clean object-oriented design provides enhanced process control, 
and the language is equipped with excellent text processing and integration capabilities, 
as well as its own unit testing framework, which makes it more efficient.)<br><br>

10)Internet of Things(IoT) Opportunities,Interpreted Language and Portable across Operating systems.<br><br>

Disadvantages:<br><br>

1)Performance: Python is an interpreted language, which means that it can be slower than 
compiled languages like C or Java. This can be an issue for performance-intensive tasks.<br><br>

2)Global Interpreter Lock: The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mechanism in Python that 
prevents multiple threads from executing Python code at once. This can limit the parallelism 
and concurrency of some applications.<br><br>

3)Memory consumption: Python can consume a lot of memory, especially when working with 
large datasets or running complex algorithms.<br><br>

4)Dynamically typed: Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that the types of 
variables can change at runtime. This can make it more difficult to catch errors and can lead to bugs.<br><br>

5)Packaging and versioning: Python has a large number of packages and libraries, which can 
sometimes lead to versioning issues and package conflicts.<br><br>

6)Lack of strictness: Python’s flexibility can sometimes be a double-edged sword. While it can 
be great for rapid development and prototyping, it can also lead to code that is difficult to read and maintain.<br><br>

7)Steep learning curve: While Python is generally considered to be a relatively easy language to 
learn, it can still have a steep learning curve for beginners, especially if they have no 
prior experience with programming.<br><br>

 <br><br><br><br>

Q10)What is dynamically typed language in python?<br><br>  

Answer :<br><br>

Python is both a strongly typed and a dynamically typed language. Strong typing means 
that variables do have a type and that the type matters when performing operations on a variable. 
Dynamic typing means that the type of the variable is determined only during runtime.<br><br>
